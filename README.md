# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Trading-Signal-Generation
An End-to-End Machine Learning Solution

**Project Overview**

This project develops a sophisticated Bitcoin price prediction system using deep learning techniques, featuring comprehensive technical analysis and automated trading signal generation. The solution combines LSTM neural networks with carefully engineered technical indicators to forecast next-day Bitcoin prices and generate actionable trading signals.
Technical Implementation
Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering:

Processed 10+ years of Bitcoin historical data (2014-2025) with OHLCV pricing
Engineered 47 initial features including technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands), moving averages, volatility measures, and cyclical time features
Applied systematic feature selection to identify 7 optimal predictors, reducing model complexity while maintaining performance

Model Architecture:

Implemented optimized LSTM architecture with 8.4K parameters (32â†’16 LSTM layers + dense layers)
Used 30-day sequences for next-day prediction with proper time-series splitting
Applied regularization techniques (dropout, early stopping) to prevent overfitting

Trading System:

Developed bias-corrected signal generation with confidence scoring
Implemented realistic backtesting framework including transaction costs
Created risk management system with adaptive thresholds

**Key Challenges Resolved**

1. Model Overfitting: Initial model showed severe overfitting (training loss: 0.001, validation: 0.21). Resolved through architectural simplification and enhanced regularization.
2. Feature Redundancy: Reduced feature space from 47 to 7 variables using domain expertise and correlation analysis, improving model generalization.
3. Systematic Bias: Discovered 5.6% systematic underestimation in predictions. Implemented bias correction algorithm to improve signal accuracy.
4. Time Series Validation: Replaced random data splitting with proper temporal validation to prevent data leakage and ensure realistic performance estimates.
Results & Performance
Model Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error: $7,653 (9.5% MAPE)
Directional Accuracy: 47.6%
Accuracy within 5% threshold: 35.6%
Performance vs. Bitcoin volatility: 220.1% efficiency ratio

Trading Performance:

Generated balanced signal distribution (46% BUY, 17% HOLD, 37% SELL)
Realistic backtesting shows 195% returns vs 356% buy-and-hold
Demonstrates strong risk management capabilities, particularly in identifying major market downturns

**Business Impact & Applications**

Risk Management: Excellent at detecting potential price drops with high confidence (>90% for major sell signals)
Market Timing: Provides valuable entry/exit decision support for portfolio managers
Research Foundation: Serves as robust baseline for advanced ensemble methods and alternative data integration
Technical Excellence
The project demonstrates production-ready ML engineering with clean code architecture, comprehensive error handling, and systematic approach to model validation. The solution successfully balances model complexity with interpretability while addressing real-world trading constraints.
Future Enhancements: Ensemble methods integration, macroeconomic feature inclusion, sentiment analysis, and reinforcement learning for adaptive trading strategies.
